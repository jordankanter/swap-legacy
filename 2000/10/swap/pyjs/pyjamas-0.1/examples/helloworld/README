This is a port of Google's Hello example.

To build, run:

    ../../builder/build.py Hello

and then open output/Hello.html in a web browser.

test.py is a simple test of the *Python source* of the example. It does not
actually *do* anything other than check for a certain class of errors in the 
source code.
