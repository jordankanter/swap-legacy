Reaching Out Onto the Web</p>

</div>


<h1>Reaching out onto the Web</h1>


<p>So what is this Semantic <em>Web</em>, anyway? Where does the <em>Web</em>
come in? So far you've shown us just a language for writing data.</p>


<p>(You <em>do</em> need to know this bit!)</p>


<h2><a name="Looking" id="Looking">Looking inside web resources:
<code>log:semantics</code> and <code>log:includes</code></a></h2>


<p>Life in the real world is full of data from different places. Rather than
putting all the data into one big pot and believing it, rules often have to
look specifically at which document said what.</p>


<p>Cwm has built-in functions to allow it to interact with the web. The
concept of a formula - a set of RDF statements - allows it to consider
separate sets of data.</p>


<p>The basic function which connects RDF to the web is <code><dfn><a name="semantics" id="semantics">log:semantics</a></dfn></code>. The
<code>log:semantics</code> of a document is the formula which one gets by
parsing a semantic web document. As it is a built-in function, when cwm needs
to evaluate it it will pick up the document (N3 or RDF/XML) and parse it,
returning the formula<a href="#L4808"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>


<p></p>

<pre>{ &lt;foo.rdf&gt; log:semantics ?f } =&gt; { ?f a :InterestingFormula}.</pre>


<p></p>


<p>Having got a formula, we can test what it says using
<code>log:includes</code>. One formula <code>log:includes</code> a second
formula if for each statement in the second, there is a corresponding one in
the first. This the same pattern matching which happens with
<code>log:implies</code> rules: the names of variables do not have to
match.</p>


<p>So let's say we we have a concept of a semantic web home page for a
person. We decide on the policy that if someone's home page says that they
are a vegetarian, then we believe that they are a vegetarian.</p>

<pre>@forAll :x.<br />{:x :homePage log:includes { :x a :Vegetarian }}=&gt; { :x a :Vegetarian}.</pre>


<p></p>


<p>Why didn't we use the <code>?x</code> form there? Well, we have some
nested formulae. The variable x is quantified in the scope of the whole
document. The definition of ?x is that it is quantified in the scope of not
the immediate formula but the next enclosing formula. So we can't use it at
different levels of nesting. We are not asking whether the home page includes
"For all x, x is vegetarian". This is an example of how one must be explicit
about the scope of variables when they are used at more than one level.</p>


<h3><a name="Implementi" id="Implementi">Implementing defaults and
<code>log:notIncludes</code></a></h3>


<p>Because a formula is a finite size, you can test for what it does
<em>not</em> say, with <code>log:notIncludes.</code> Here, we have a rule
that is the specification for a car doesn't say what color it is then it is
black.</p>

<pre>@forAll :car.<br />{ :car.auto:specification log:notIncludes {:car auto:color []}}<br />    =&gt; {:car auto:color auto:black}.</pre>


<p></p>


<p>Note the use of [] here in the nested formula as a blank node. If the spec
said that a car had color green, then that would mean that the car had color
something, so we would say that the formula included <code>:car auto:color
[]</code> . A statement with a [] in it you can think of as weaker version of
one with a value for the color.</p>


<p>This is a way to do defaults. Notation3 as it is doesn't have defaults,
because on the web, you can't say "if nothing says it is another color". You
can never know in the whole web whether anyone has given a color. Also, if we
start to just loosely talk about defaults in the sense of <em>if you don't
already know a color</em>, then different agents will end up drawing
different conclusions from the same data, which is not a good foundation for
a scalable web. So, you handle defaults by first running rules to work out
everything which is specified, and then on the result of that do a
<code>notIncludes</code> rule like that above to implement the default
values.</p>


<h2>Thinking inside thinking with <code>log:conclusion</code></h2>


<p>To do some inference within another set of rules, a useful relationship is
that between a formula, and the result of thinking about it - running any
rules in the formula on all the data, recursively just like cwm's
<code>--think</code> command line option. This relationship is
log:conclusion. To make the initial formula, you can use
<code>log:conjunction</code> to merge a list of formulae.</p>

<pre>{   ( &lt;input.data&gt;.log:semantics <br />      &lt;axioms.n3&gt;.log:semantics<br />      &lt;system-rules.n3&gt;.log:semantics ) log:conjunction :f.<br />    :f log:conclusion :g.<br />    :g log:notIncludes {  :request a :ValidRequest }<br />} =&gt; {<br />    :request a InvalidRequest<br />}.</pre>


<p>This means: if what you get by taking the input data, the axioms and the
system rules together and thinking about it doesn't tell you that the request
is valid, then it is invalid.</p>


<h2><a name="More" id="More">More peeking: <code>log:content</code>,
<code>log:n3String</code>, <code>log:uri</code></a></h2>


<p></p>


<p>The nice thing about <code>log:semantics</code> is that it deals with all
the web protocols in one simple function. This is a simple, clean, view of
the web as a set of interwoven formulae.</p>


<p>It is possible also to get a little more involved, using the following
functions which separate the looking up from the parsing.</p>

<dl>

  <dt><code>log:uri</code></dt>

    <dd>The uri of a resource. <code><br />

      &lt;http://example.org/&gt; log:uri "http://example.org/".</code> <br />

      Normal logic processing doesn't look at URIs but in some cases one
      needs to. This is a level-breaker: it lets an N3 system look at its
      infrastructure. It is a function which cwm can evaluate either way:
      resource to URI or URI to resource.</dd>

  <dt><code>log:content</code></dt>

    <dd>For a document, the string which was returned as the document
      contents when the URI of the resource was looked up.</dd>

  <dt><code>log:parsedAsN3</code></dt>

    <dd>For a string, the formula you get by parsing it as a Notation3
      document.</dd>

  <dt><code>log:N3String</code></dt>

    <dd>For a formula, a string which expressed that formula in N3.</dd>

  <dt></dt>

    <dd></dd>

</dl>


<p>One of the uses of this, as we will see in the next section, is to test
the digital signature of a string before accepting the data encoded in it.</p>


<h2><a name="Getting1" id="Getting1">Getting results from the web:</a>
<code>log:definitiveService</code> and
<code>log:definitiveDocument</code></h2>


<p></p>


<p>There is some properties for which there is just a well-defined set of
values. The state codes of the US states is an example. There are 50 states,
and each has one state code and one state name. Once you know them, you know
them. Once you know where to look them up, you can resolve any query about
them. That's got to be useful. It is represented by giving, somewhere, a
<code>log:definitiveDocument</code> for a the property. This is metadata -
data about data. You have a lot of control over where cwm will look for
metadata, and how it will use it.</p>


<p>This behaviour is controllable in cwm by the --mode flags. By default cwm
won't doing anything about it at all. (See:<a href="cwm.html#Mode">Cwm's
--mode flags</a> in manual page). When cwm runs with r and s mode flags, and
it finds in the query it i strying to match a statement whose predicate has a
definitive document, then it will read the document, and search it (alone) to
resolve that query.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The<strong>r</strong>flag is necessary for any of this to work. This
causes it to check for metadata in the working formula - the current
dataset.</p>


<p>The <strong>s</strong> flag makes cwm also check for schemas. It does this
only when trying to resolve a query. If the predicate is from a namespace it
doesn't know, it will go to the web to see what it can learn. Unless the
<strong>e</strong>flag is set, then it won't mind if there are any errors in
this process, it will just abandon it.</p>


<p>Most vocabularies, ontologies, have all kinds of metadata which helps a
query engine resolve questions posed using those terms. Much of the
interesting semantic web development will be in seeing what kind of meta data
is most useful to leave, and how best to use it. The definitiveDocument
property is a simple one, and the simplest way of using it is to let cwm pick
it up either from the current store or a schema.</p>


<p>For an example, look at this <a href="../test/dbork/defdoc2.n3">file</a>
expressing query involving US state information.</p>

<pre>@prefix : &lt;#&gt;. </pre>

<pre>@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt;.<br />@prefix state: &lt;data/USRegionState.n3#&gt; .<br />@prefix city: &lt;data/USCity.n3#&gt;.<br /># Question: What cities are in states bordering Massachusetts?<br /><br />{"MA"^state:code.state:borderstate^city:state city:name ?n}<br />   =&gt;{    ?n a :NAME_OF_CITY_IN_A_STATE_BORDERING_MASSACHUSETTS }.</pre>


<p>Its a rather random example (think of a better one? let us know! ;-), to
look up the states bordering Massachusetts, and specifically the names of
major cities in that state. Massachusetts is identified as the state with
state code "MA". So what happens if we load this into cwm and do a --think?
Nothing. Cwm just prints out the file reformatted. Now run it in remote query
mode with schema fetch:</p>


<p></p>

<pre>cwm http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/dbork/defdoc2.n3 --mode=rse --think</pre>


<p></p>


<p>and -- voila -- we get:</p>

<pre>    "Albany"     a :NAME_OF_CITY_IN_A_STATE_BORDERING_MASSACHUSETTS .<br />    <br />    "Amherst"     a :NAME_OF_CITY_IN_A_STATE_BORDERING_MASSACHUSETTS .<br />    <br />    "Avon"     a :NAME_OF_CITY_IN_A_STATE_BORDERING_MASSACHUSETTS .<br /><br />    ...</pre>


<p>and so on.</p>


<p></p>


<p>To do more fancy things, you can run cwm in a mode which loads the</p>

<p>By now you should know how to publish tables of useful information on the
semantic web. You should know how to use published data and semantic web
services and SQL servers to answer parts of your queries. You are starting to
get into some useful scalable stuff, and the next thing you know you'll be
needing to reign in your system before it explores the whole world. You'll be
needing to think about trust. Fortunately, you already have some of the
tools: you can write rules which keep track of data from different places
separately. Now all you need is some crypto ....</p>

<p><a name="L4808" id="L4808">1.</a> Of course, the value of this function
depends on the real world, which can change. Many systems either assume that
other documents won't change, or accept that the information derived from
them will change with them. It is would also possible to model the time at
which a given representation of a document was returned by a server, and what
expiry date was given, and so on, and the reader is welcome to experiment
with such schemes where they are needed. Cwm does not currently( 2003/2)
provide the functionality of looking inside the HTTP response to extract the
protocol headers which convey time-related information.</p>
