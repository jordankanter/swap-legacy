<h1>Motivations for N3</h1>

<p>The N3 language -- and the SWAP code such as Cwm which experiments with it
and demonstrates it -- were motivated by a desire to show the semantic web
working in a practical, tryable prototype, with the minimum of fuss and
clutter. Minimum fuss includes an absence of extra features: this suggests a
tactic of reusing existing features as far as possible - to push the bounds
of one style or pattern until it is demonstrably unreasonable, (and then to
stop!).</p>

<h2><a href="/DesignIssues/Notation3.html">N3</a> requirements</h2>

<p>The Semantic Web involves doing things with data and logic but using URIs
for identifiers, so that the semantics of symbols can be shared with other
applications and other agents across the world.</p>

<p>Notaion3 is a language for interchange which is designed to span and
integrate many levels, from data transfer to the expression of logic, proof
and trust.</p>

<h3>A data language</h3>

<p>The first task of N3 was to allow data - pure facts -to be written down
simply and easily in a text file -- or in an IRC chat channel, for that
matter. RDF had evolved as a way of expressing any data, be it tables, trees
or mixtures of the above in a circles and arrows, but the XML format was too
verbose for use in conversation, on a whiteboard.</p>

<p>The ";" and "," syntaxes followed from an observation that often many
values were given for the same predicate on the same subject, and much data
was given for the same subject.</p>

<p>Most of the information in most real systems is data (although the balance
between data and rules varies widely). Even the ontology layer (OWL) is
expressible using the data language. So RDF schemas and ontologies (unlike
SGML and XML DTDs) are expressed in the same language.</p>

<p>A goal of N3 was not only to make a concise and usable language for data,
but also to show how much could be done by using that data language.</p>

<h3>A framework for logic</h3>

<p>The semantics web layer cake is a simplified roadmap showing how many
languages of different expressive power will be useful, and must interoperate
as much as possible on the Web.</p>

<p>One aim of N3 was to make a transition to the expressive power of various
languages to include rules and queries, in as seamless a way as reasonable
from the data representation language. Axioms of the RDFS and OWL layers can
be represented in N3, not because the logic is a FOL whose expressivity
includes OWL, but rather because the quoting and substitution used by cwm's
log:includes allows any syntactic graph-to-graph transform to be
expressed.</p>

<h3>Quoting</h3>

<p>On this Web of information, much of that information is about other
information. Indeed, the first driver for a common language for data was data
about information resources (hence the now rather outdated name <em>Resource
Description Framework</em>). In this environment, attempts to avoid paradox
by avoiding data referring to data are not going to work. An alternative
approach is to embrace quoting - to be able to make comments in one document
about other documents without imposing any acyclic requirement on the whole
global system.</p>

<p>Information work in a real world necessarily involves considering
information without just adding it to the pile of things one believes. An
agent makes his or her or its way through life considering who said what.
This requires <strong>referential opacity</strong> to distinguish between
talking about Mary and saying "Mary", to distinguish between what a document
actually said and what you would now infer from what it said.</p>

<h3>Re-use</h3>

<p>The interesting thing about Semantic Web data -- and rules -- is that it
can be re-used in ways not designed by its originator. This works better for
modular and declarative information than for monolithic or procedural
information. Therefore, N3 is <em>not</em> required to be so much as as
scripting language (although [1]) as to be able to express rules in a way
which will make the re-usable out of context.</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a href="cwm.html">Cwm</a> requirements</h2>

<p>Cwm is designed to implement as much of the Semantic Web layer cake as
possible to show (a) that it could be done and (b) what the semantic web was
about.</p>

<p>It is not designed to be particularly efficient, to scale well for large
datasets or large rulesets. There are a host of interesting algorithms which
have been used in existing systems including databases including the SQL
world, forward and backward chaining inference systems, including Prolog all
the logic programming world, and KIF and the Knowledge Representation world.
The idea is not that the cwm inference engine is special, rather that it not
special: you can take any inference system and webize it, and make a semantic
web agent. Webizing involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix the language so that the identifiers use namespaces (or something)
    to actually be URIs;</li>
  <li>Fix the software so that URIs can be used as URIs not just as
    identifiers but as URIs.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Each URI scheme has different properties and making the software aware of
them and capable of implementing them makes it a true Semantic <em>Web</em>
application, not just a "Semantic" application.</p>

<p>So goals for cwm include the ability to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>look up documents on the web;</li>
  <li>look inside semantic web documents on the web without believing
  them;</li>
  <li>create and verify digital signatures of documents.</li>
  <li>Resolve queries using  metadata found by dereferencing identifiers of
    terms in query 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
