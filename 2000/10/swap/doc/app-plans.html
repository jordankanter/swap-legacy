<p>You don't get an appreciation of a technology until you have tried to usit
for real. We have plans to use the cwm platform for many things -- we don't
know how much we will time for.</p>

<h2>Software installation problem</h2>

<p></p>

<p>Each module lives on the web, and can be installed on demand, but also the
dependencies are all known or determined, and the system can transparently
install a system by just making a persistent cache of everything. Do this to
(a) OWL ontologies and linked metainformation; (b) Sets of rule files; (c)
debian packages (d) python packages -- with a little tweaking of the insides
of the python package system. G</p>

<p></p>

<p>General problem statement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Article <em><a href="/DesignIssues/Installation.html">Installation,
    Catalogs, and Caches</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Ontologies involved (find, or collborate in development of)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dependency</li>
  <li>Packaging includion</li>
  <li>Versioning, obsolescence</li>
</ul>

<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>getting from one state to another (eg uninstalled to installed, etc) is
    goal-based.</li>
  <li>Making a user aware of the total amount of resources used by a given
    top-level need is a graphic user interface challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Secure systems from scratch</h2>

<p></p>

<p>One goal here is to build a system without relying on external agencies to
provide key infrastrurcture, authentication, so that the whole system is
expressed in N3, and proofs can therefore be don..</p>

<p>An alternative goal is to import an existing systems such as PKI, XKMS,
GPGinto the RDF world by interfacing to the existing systems and converting
into and out of RDF.</p>

<p>It would not be a goal to develop a specific ontology for policy as a
standard or recommended one -- we assume that policy systems will take much
time to develop.</p>

<p>A goal would be to test the proof-checking techniques. Cwm's --why flag
would produce a proof of its current knoweldge base, which a proof validator
could verify, regenerating the knowledge base. This code has (2004) rotted in
that it wasnot kept up to date with advances in the platform.</p>

<p>Example problem statement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple access control example</li>
</ul>

<p>Ontologies involved (find, or collborate in development of)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital signature generation and verification; 
    <p>Proof</p>
  </li>
  <li>Policy in the target ssytem such as access control, transaction
    authorization, etc etc. 
    <p>Possibly: RDF ontologies correspnding to existing systems such as
    XKMS, PKI, PGP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proof verification</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Information Management (PIM) Integration</h2>

<p></p>

<p>We have done a lot of this already, but there is a lot mroe to do.</p>

<p>Ontologies involved (find, or collborate in development of)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calendar events (iCalendar)</li>
  <li>Tax forms</li>
  <li>Bank statements</li>
  <li>GPS tracks 
    <p>Maps</p>
  </li>
  <li>Email metadata</li>
  <li>Email lists as group membership</li>
  <li>Photo (EXIF)</li>
  <li>Tasks, Bug tracking 
    <p>Workflow</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2>The mass of rules</h2>

<p></p>

<p>Imagine that the semantic web has taken off in the sense that there are
lots of ontologies out there.  Imagine that there are sources of data, and
for some properties, definitive servers.  Imagine that the ontologies have
been linked together using OWL statements and rules. (Example: there is a
trusted document somewhere which tell you how to convert Fahrenheit 
<code>f:temperature</code>  into Celsius <code>c:temperature</code>).</p>

<p>How can you make a machine to answer arbitrary questions given what is out
there? One approaach is to index the rules.  Assume you can keep a copy of
them all one one computer. Index them by input and output vocabulary, at the
ontology and/or term level.</p>
