<h1>Glossary</h1>

<p>These are not formal definitions - just phrases to help you get the hang
of what these things mean. The definition terms are linked back to more
information where available.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="#Class" name="Class1" id="Class1">Class</a></dt>
    <dd>A set of <a href="#Thing">Things</a>; a one-parameter predicate; a
      unary relation.</dd>
  <dt><a name="DAML" id="DAML">DAML</a></dt>
    <dd>Darpa Agent Markup Langauge. This is DARPA's name for the US
      govenment funded projects which led to, among other things, OWL. The <a
      href="http://www.daml.org/">DAML site</a> has useful pointers and
      registries of useful ontologies and data in RDF.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Domain" id="Domain" href="#domain">domain</a></dt>
    <dd>For a <a href="#Property">Property</a>, a class of things which any
      subject of the <a href="#Property">Property</a> must be in.</dd>
  <dt><a href="#context" name="Formula" id="Formula">Formula</a></dt>
    <dd>An (unordered) set of <a href="#Statement">statements</a>. You can
      write one out in N3 using {braces}.</dd>
  <dt><a name="context1" id="context1">context</a></dt>
    <dd>The relationship between a statement and a formula containing it.</dd>
  <dt><a href="doc/cwm" name="cwm" id="cwm">cwm</a></dt>
    <dd>(From: Closed world machine; valley.) A bit of code for playing with
      this stuff, as grep is for regular expressions. Sucks in RDF in XML or
      N3, processes rules, and spits it out again.</dd>
  <dt><a name="existentia" id="existentia">existential variable</a></dt>
    <dd>A term in a language (such as N3) which stands in place of a normal
      symbol, allowing one to consider a formula being true for some symbol
      being put consistently in place of the variable.</dd>
  <dt><a name="filter" id="filter" href="#filter1">filter</a></dt>
    <dd>A set of <a href="#rule">rules</a> which are used to select certain
      data from a larger amount of information.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Formula1" id="Formula1">Formula</a></dt>
    <dd>A set of <a href="#Statement">statements</a>, with a list of
      universally quanitified variables and a list of existentially
      quantified variables. In N3, a literal formula if representated by
      braces {}.</dd>
  <dt><a name="N3" id="N3" href="/DesignIssues/Notation3">N3</a></dt>
    <dd>Notation3, a quick notation for jotting down or reading RDF semantic
      web information, and experimenting with more advanced sematic web
      features.</dd>
  <dt><a name="object" id="object" href="#L553">object</a></dt>
    <dd>Of the three parts of a statement, the object is one of the two
      things related by the predicate. Often, it is the value of some
      property, such as the color of a car. See also: subject, predicate.</dd>
  <dt><a name="OWL" id="OWL">OWL</a></dt>
    <dd>The Web Ontology Language standard from W3C. Currently (2003/04) on
      the Recommensation track. An RDF vocabulary.</dd>
  <dt><a name="predicate" id="predicate">predicate</a></dt>
    <dd>Of the three parts of a statement, the predicate, or verb, is the
      resource, specifically the Property, which defines what the statement
      means. See also: subject, object.</dd>
  <dt><a href="#Properties" name="Property" id="Property">Property</a></dt>
    <dd>A sort of relationship between two things; a binary relation. A
      Property can be used as the <a href="#predicate">predicate</a> in a <a
      href="#Statement">statement</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="range1" id="range1" href="#range">range</a></dt>
    <dd>For a <a href="#Property">Property</a>, its range is a class which
      any <a href="#object">object</a> of that <a
      href="#Property">Property</a> must be in.</dd>
  <dt><a name="rule" id="rule">rule</a></dt>
    <dd>A loose term for a Statement that an engine has been programmed to
      process. Different engines have different sets of rules. <a
      href="#cwm">cwm</a> rules are <a href="#Statement">statements</a> whose
      verb is <code>log:implies</code>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Resource" id="Resource">Resource</a></dt>
    <dd>That identified by a Universal Resource Identifier (without a "#").
      If the URI starts "http:", then the resource is some form of generic
      document.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Statement" id="Statement1">Statement</a></dt>
    <dd>A subject, predicate and object which assert meaning defined by the
      particular predicate used.</dd>
  <dt><a name="subject" id="subject">subject</a></dt>
    <dd>Of the three parts of a statement, the subject is one of the two
      things related by the predicate. Often, it indicates the thing being
      described, such as a car whos color and length are being given. See
      also: object, predicate</dd>
  <dt><a name="Thing" id="Thing">Thing</a></dt>
    <dd>In OWL, a generic name for anything - abstract, animate, inanimate,
      whatever. The class which anything is in. (In RDF parlance,
      confusingly, rdf:Resource.) Identified by a URI with or without a "#"
      in it. <strong>Tip:</strong> Saying something is a Thing doesn't tell
      anyone anything, which is why you don't see it much.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Truth" id="Truth">Truth</a></dt>
    <dd>In the log: namespace, a Class of all formulae which are true.</dd>
  <dt><a name="type" id="type">type</a></dt>
    <dd>A particular property used to assert that a thing is in a certain
      Class. The relationship between a thing and any Class it is in.</dd>
  <dt><a name="universal" id="universal">universal variable</a></dt>
    <dd>A term in a language (such as N3) which stands in place of a normal
      symbol, allowing one to consider a formula being true for any symbol
      being put consistently in place of the variable.</dd>
  <dt><a name="URI" id="URI">URI</a></dt>
    <dd>Universal Resource Identifier. The way of identifying anything
      (including Classes, Properties or individual things of any sort). Not
      everything has a URI, as you can talk about something by just using its
      properties. But using a URI allows other documents and systems to
      easily reuse your information.</dd>
  <dt><a name="variable" id="variable">variable</a></dt>
    <dd>Either a <a href="#universal">universal variable</a> or an <a
      href="#existentia">existential variable</a>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
