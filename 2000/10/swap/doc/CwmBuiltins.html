<p class='ns'>@prefix crypto: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>CanEncrypt</td><td class='comment'>PublicKeyObjects which are capable of encrypting things</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>CanSign</td><td class='comment'>PublicKeyObjects which are capable of signing things.
True if the algorithm is capable of signing data; false otherwise. To
test if a given key object can sign data, use CanSign and HasPrivate.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>HasPrivate</td><td class='comment'>
Some keys have private parts, some don't.  This is the class of those which do.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>HashFunction</td><td class='comment'>
The crypographic hash functions are (being functions) unique and are,
when secure, assumed unambiguous (the whole point of being hash
functions). That is, when you have the right hash, you have the right
document. Currently (2001/9) only SHA is given that property.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>PublicKeyObject</td><td class='comment'>An object corresponding to a key for some algorithm.
The object can hold a public and optionally a private key.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>md5</td><td class='comment'>The object is a MD5 hash of the subject.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>publicKey</td><td class='comment'>The object is a public key object that doesn't
    contain the private key data in the subject.
    This function extracts the public part.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>sha</td><td class='comment'>The object is a SHA-1 hash of the subject.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>sign</td><td class='comment'>The subject should be a list of two things, a hash
string and a key (containing private and public parts). The object is
calculated as a signature string by signing the hash with the key's
private part.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>verify</td><td class='comment'>If the subject is a key object containing private and
public parts and the obejct is a list of a hash and a signature, then
this is true if and only if the signature is a valid signature of the
hash with the key.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>verifyBoolean</td><td class='comment'>If the subject is a list containg a keypair, a hash,
and a signature, then the object is either "1" if the signature
validates or "0" if it does not.</td></tr>
</table><h2> list</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix list: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/list#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>append</td><td class='comment'>
Iff the subject is a list of lists and the concatenation of all those lists 
is the object, then this is true.
eg  ( (1 2) (3 4) ) list:append (1 2 3 4).
The object can be calculated as a function of the subject.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>in</td><td class='comment'>
Iff the object is a list and the subject is in that list, then this is true.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>last</td><td class='comment'>
Iff the suject is a list and the obbject is the last thing that list, then this is true.
The object can be calculated as a function of the list.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>member</td><td class='comment'>
Iff the subject is a list and the obbject is in that list, then this is true.
</td></tr>
</table><h2> log</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>Chaff</td><td class='comment'>Any statement mentioning anything in this class
is considered boring and purged by the cwm --purge option.
This is a convenience, and does not have any value when published as a
general fact on the web.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>N3Document</td><td class='comment'>A document which, which parsed as Notation3
as defined in general by http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html
and this schema, conveys the intent of the author by the semantics defined
on those specifications, and the semantics defined by the specifications
of any other identifiers used in the document.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>Truth</td><td class='comment'>Something which is true: believe it as you would believe this.
    
	Understood natively by cwm in that it will execute rules in a formula
	declared a Truth within a formula it is already taking rules from.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>conclusion</td><td class='comment'>All possible conclusions which can be drawn from a formula.

The object of this function, a formula, is the set of conclusions which can be
drawn from the subject formula, by successively applying any
rules it contains to the data it contains. This is equivalent to
cwm's "--think" command line function.  It does use built-ins, so
it may for example indirectly invoke other documents, validate
signatures, etc.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>conjunction</td><td class='comment'>"A function to merge formulae: logical AND.

The subject is a list of formulae.
The object, which can be generated, is a formula containing a copy
of each of the formulae in the list on the left.
A cwm built-in function.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>content</td><td class='comment'>This connects a document and a string that represents it.
(Cwm knows how to go get a document in order to evaluate this.)
Note that the content-type of the information is not given and
so must be known or guessed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>definitiveDocument</td><td class='comment'>	When document D is the definitiveDocument for property P,
any statement X P Y is true iff and only if the semantics of document D
include that statement.

For example, there may be a definitive document for the zipcode of
airports by airport code, and so on. This is useful to let a reasoner
know that it can extend its query to the given document.
(Cwm will do this if its mode includes "r").
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>definitiveService</td><td class='comment'>	When service S is the definitiveService for property P,
any statement X P Y is true iff and only if a query to S returns
that it is.  The protocol for the service S depends on the scheme.
For mysql protocol, the URI of the service is like
sql://user:password@host.domain/database/.

For example, there may be a definitive service for the zipcode of
airports by airport code, and so on. This is useful to let a reasoner
know that it can help resolve a query by delegating it to the service
in question.
(Cwm will do this if its mode includes "r").
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>dtlit</td><td class='comment'>Takes a list of a string and a URI and creates a datatyped
     literal. For example, { ("2005-03-30T11:00:00" :tz) log:dtlit ?X } => { ?X a :Answer } .
    will produce "2005-03-30T11:00:00"^^:tz a :Answer .</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>equalTo</td><td class='comment'>True if the subject and object are the same RDF node (symbol or literal).
Do not confuse with owl:sameAs.
A cwm built-in logical operator, RDF graph level.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>implies</td><td class='comment'>Logical implication. 
This is the relation between the antecedent (subject) and
conclusion (object) of a rule.
The application of a rule to a knowledge-base is as follows.
For every substitution which, applied to the antecedent,
gives a formula which is a subset of the knowledge-base,
then the result of applying that same substitution to the
conclusion may be added to the knowledge-base.

related: See log:conclusion. 
(See the CWM manual for command line options to determine how
rules from different sources are applied to and the results
added to various formula.)
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>includes</td><td class='comment'>The subject formula includes the object formula.
Formula A includes formula B if there exists some substitution
which when applied to B creates a formula B' such that for
every statement in B' is also in A, every variable
universally (or existentially) quantified in B' is quantified in
the same way in A. 

Variable substitution is applied recursively to nested compound terms such as
formulae, lists and sets.

(Understood natively by cwm when in in the antecedent of a rule.
You can use this to peer inside nested formulae.)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>n3String</td><td class='comment'>The subject formula, expressed as N3, gives this string.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notEqualTo</td><td class='comment'>Equality in this sense is actually the same URI.
A cwm built-in logical operator.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>notIncludes</td><td class='comment'>The object formula is NOT a subset of subject.
    True iff log:includes is false.
    The converse of log:includes. (Understood natively by cwm.
    The subject formula may contain variables.
    (In cwm, variables must of course end up getting bound
    before the log:include test can be done, or an infinite result set
    would result)
    Related: See includes</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>outputString</td><td class='comment'>The subject is a key and the object is a string,
where the strings are to be output in the order of the keys.
See cwm --strings in cwm --help.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>parsedAsN3</td><td class='comment'>The subject string, parsed as N3, gives this formula.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>racine</td><td class='comment'>For anything identified by a URI with a fragid, this is the
thing identified by the same URI without a hash or fragid.
For anything else, it is itself.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>rawType</td><td class='comment'>
This is a low-level language type, one of log:Formula, log:Literal, 
log:List, log:Set or log:Other. 
Example: log:semanticsOrError returns either a formula or a string,
and you can check which using log:rawType.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>rawUri</td><td class='comment'>This allows one to look at the actual string of the URI which identifies this,
for anything, even a blank node or a formula. This peeks into the internal
workings of cwm, and so is not normally used. Use log:uri instead.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>semantics</td><td class='comment'>The log:semantics of a document is the formula.
achieved by parsing representation of the document.
 For a document in Notation3, log:semantics is the
log:parsedAsN3 of the log:contents of the document.
For a document in RDF/XML, it is parsed according to the
RDF/XML specification to yield an RDF formula
(a subclass of N3 log:Formula).

[Aside: Philosophers will be distracted here into worrying about the meaning
of meaning. At least we didn't call this function "meaning"!
In as much as N3 is used as an interlingua for interoperability
for different systems, this for an N3 based system is the meaning 
expressed by a document.]

(Cwm knows how to go get a document and parse N3 and RDF/XML
it in order to evaluate this.
Other languages for web documents 
may be defined whose N3 semantics are therefore
also calculable, and so they could be added in due course.
See for example GRDDL, RDFa, etc)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>semanticsOrError</td><td class='comment'>This connects a document and either the formula it parses to,
or an error message explaining what went wrong with trying. See log:semantics.
(Cwm knows how to go get a document and parse it in order to evaluate this.)
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>uri</td><td class='comment'>This allows one to look at the actual string of the URI which identifies this.

(Cwm can get the URI of a resource or get the resource from the URI.)
This is a level breaker, breaking the rule of not looking inside a
URI.   Use (eg with  string:match) to replace RDF's old "aboutEach"
functionality. Use to implement the URI spec and protocol specs, etc.

</table><h2> os</h2>
<p class='ns'>@prefix os: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/os#&gt;.</p>
<table>  <tr><td class='ln'>argv</td><td class='comment'>The object is looked up as the literal string which was given
as the nth command line argument. 
    
    The os:argv property allows one to make statements whose interpretation
is relative to the conditions pertaining at the time of execution. Beware
of writing axioms about these, in making optimizations for example about
reuse of information between runs.  The uniqueness of this property pertains
to one run of a program.  The ont:UniqueProperty may be removed if it
messes up more complex processing.

(For example, cwm uses a "-with" argument
to indicate that the following args should be passed to the RDF system.

Example:
    cwm foo.n3 -think -with bar baz
    when processing,   {"1" os:argv "bar". "2" os:arv "baz"} will be true)

</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>baseAbsolute</td><td class='comment'>The baseAbsolute property of a URI reference string is a string
which is an (absolute) URI, generated assuming the
base of the running process.  This will, for example,
generate a file: URI from a unix relative file path when running
in file: space.  (Cwm uses the current working directory as a base
unless the --base option is given)
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>baseRelative</td><td class='comment'>The baseRelative property of a URI string is a string
which is a valid relative form of the URI, relative to the
base of the running process.  The base of a running unix
process is typically a file: URI for the file being processed,
or just the current working directory followed by a "/".

The relative form is suitable for quotation in a file
whose URI is the same (except for anything after the last slash).
</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='ln'>environ</td><td class='comment'>
The os:environ property of a string is the value corresponding to
the string when looked up in the curent environment.  This is
not, of course, something of global significance: it is only
used in local processing for passing parameters into a semantic web
processor.  The subject is the name of the environment variable
and the object its value.

os:environ is a built-in function in cwm, and corresponds
to Python's os.environ[] .
