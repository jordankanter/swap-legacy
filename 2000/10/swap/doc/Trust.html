Reaching Out Onto the Web</p>

<h1>Trust</h1>


<p>In the real world, you don't want a program doing things without being
careful. One of the more difficult things is figuring out what rules you
really use for deciding what data to trust. The Semantic Web doesn't make
that social problem much easier. When you have figured out a trust model, the
Semantic Web allows you to write it down. Not only that -- if we introduce
cryptographic built-in functions, we can actually make a system which will
use public key cryptography to check the authenticity of data.</p>


<p>This can of course get very big, and as complicated as your social or
business environment. However, we can give a taste with a simple example. The
idea here is not to learn this particular cryptographic library, but to get
the feel of what can be done.</p>


<h2>Delegated authority</h2>


<p>Suppose we want to set up an access control system for the W3C <em>Member
site</em>. (Yes, even though companies support W3C just because is a good
thing, many quite reasonably need this "what's in it for me?"
justification).</p>


<p>We will formalize the social arrangements and then we will write the rules
which encapsulate those arrangements so that they can be followed by a
machine. Let's just take the case of a web page which is only accessible to
W3C members. What does that mean? Well, when a company or organization joins
the W3C Advisory Committee representative is chosen as the liaison between
everyone at the organization and everything happening at W3C. Currently
(2003) when someone says they belong to a company and want to access the
member site in that role, we check, by email, with the AC rep. Let's design a
system to do it with digital signature.</p>


<p><img alt="example of trust processing" src="../../../../2002/Talks/04-sweb/elisaaccess.png" /></p>


<p>In this picture, Alan Kotok is the W3C associate chairman who deals with
membership. In this case, Kari is the AC rep for W3C member <em>Elisa
Communications</em>. Alan delegates to Kari the right to say who, as a
employee of Elisa, get access to the W3C Member Site.</p>



<p>Alan's authority to define who is a W3C is represented by a digital key.
he generates it using the command</p>

<pre>cwm access-gen-master.n3 --think --purge &gt; access-master.private</pre>


<p></p>


<p>where the access-gen-master.n3 contains:</p>

<pre>#  Generate master key<br /><br />@prefix : &lt;#&gt; .<br />@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt; .<br />@prefix crypto: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto#&gt; .<br />@prefix string: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/string#&gt; .<br />@prefix acc: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/crypto/acc.n3#&gt;.<br /><br />@forAll :x , :y.<br /><br /><br />{ :x crypto:keyLength "1024";<br />     crypto:publicKey :y } log:implies {<br /> :x a acc:MasterKeyPair; a acc:Secret.  :y a acc:MasterKey } .<br /><br />log:implies a log:Chaff.</pre>


<p></p>


<p>The <code>crypto:keyLength</code> built-in generates :x, which a string
which actually contains both the private and the public keys. This is
convenient, as anyone who knows a private key needs to keep track of which
public key goes with it. This is not a very semantic web function, as it
isn't repeatable rule you can reuse - it is just a trick for generating a
key. (It will generate a different key each time, although the library at one
stage didn't do that to make debugging easier).</p>


<p>The <code>crypto:publicKey</code> builtin is a function which strips out
the private parts of a key :x, leaving only the public part :y. Note we have
class here <code>:Secret</code> which we just use for labelling things which
we don't want another person to know.</p>


<p>The log:Chaff part is to label those bits which are for deletion by the
--purge command, just to leave the key file clean of stuff we don't want.</p>


<p>Kari also generates a key, which represents the authority has as Elisa's
representative. he does this in an identical fashion, using
<code>access-gen-elisa.n3</code>. The actual passing of authority happens
when Kari gives the public part of his key to Alan, in some way secure enough
for Alan to be sure enough it , and Alan then signs something to the effect
that it is indeed Kari's key as AC rep for Elisa.</p>

<pre>cwm access-elisa.public access-master.private access-sign-member-cert.n3 \<br /> --think --purge --with "Elisa" &gt; access-eliza.cert</pre>


<p>Here, Alan uses the private key which he (alone) has access to and the
public key which Kari gave him. <code>access-sign-member-cert.n3</code> is a
rule file which does the signing. It contains, in essence:</p>

<pre>{ :n is os:argv of "1".<br />  :tk a acc:MemberKey.<br />  { :tk a acc:MemberKey;<br />        acc:authorityName :n;<br />        acc:junk "327462sjsdfjsakdhfkjsafd32164321"<br />   } log:n3String :str.<br />   :kp a acc:MasterKeyPair.<br />   :k a acc:MasterKey.<br />   ([is crypto:md5 of :str] :kp) crypto:sign :z<br />} =&gt; {<br />   :str acc:endorsement[acc:signature :z; acc:key :k<br />} .</pre>


<p></p>


<p>:n resolves to be the name "Elisa", :tk resolves to be Elisa's public key.
The string str is string form of the certificate formula, as the digital
signatures work on strings. The MD5 checksum of the string is formed, and
that is signed with the master key pair (:kp). All this happens as the left
hand side of the rule is resolved, and when it has, then the conclusion is
that that string has an endorsement which has a given signature and a given
public key. This endorsement information is the certificate.</p>


<p>In exactly the same fashion, Tiina, the employee, makes a key, and gets a
certificate from Kari about that key.</p>


<p>Then the time comes that Tiina wants to access the member site. She makes
up a request for the web page, and signs it with her private key.</p>

<pre>cwm access-tiina.private access-sign-request.n3 \<br /> --think --purge --with http://www.w3.org/Member &gt; access-1.request</pre>


<p>The with command passes in the URI of the page she would like to
access.</p>


<p>The crux of this whole system is the file <code>access-rule.n3</code>
which tells the web site how to trust a request. And the crux of that is its
first rule. It is a bit simple but you should get the idea. It says that:</p>


<blockquote>
  
  <p>if a request is supported by a key, and there is a certificate -- signed
  itself with k2 -- which says k is a good request key, and that there is
  some other certificate, signed with the master key, that says that k2 is a
  member key, then the request is a good request.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The other details of what "supported" means are below.</p>


<p></p>

<pre>@forAll :d, :F, :G, :k, :k2, :k3, :kp, :x, :request, :sig, :str, :y , :z , :q .<br /><br /># The rule of access.<br />#<br />#  acc:requestSupportedBy means that it correctly claimed to be<br />#        signed by the given key.<br /><br />{ :request a acc:GoodRequest } is log:implies of<br />{<br />    :request acc:forDocument :d;<br />             acc:requestSupportedBy :k.<br /><br />    []       acc:certSupportedBy :k2;    # Certificate<br />             log:includes { :k a acc:RequestKey }.<br /><br />    []       acc:certSupportedBy [a acc:MasterKey];    # Certificate<br />             log:includes { :k2 a acc:MemberKey }.<br /><br />}.<br /><br />#  What is a Master key?<br />#<br />#  (we could just put in the text here)<br /><br />{ &lt;access-master.public&gt; log:semantics [<br />        log:includes {:x a acc:MasterKey}]<br />} log:implies {:x a acc:MasterKey}.<br /><br /><br />#  What do we belive is a request?<br />#  We trust the command line in defining what is a request.<br /><br />{  "1"!os:argv!os:baseAbsolute^log:uri log:semantics :F.<br />   :F log:includes { :str acc:endorsement[acc:signature :sig; acc:key :k]}.<br />   :k crypto:verify ([is crypto:md5 of :str] :sig).<br />   :str log:parsedAsN3:G } log:implies { :G acc:requestSupportedBy :k }.<br /><br />#  What do we believe from a signed request?<br />#   - what it says it is asking for.<br />#   - what it quotes as credentials<br />#  It could actually enclose a copy of the credentials inline,<br />#  but here we use the web.

<p></p>


<p>The important thing is that we are really trusting very specific
information from different sources.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Here is the complete data flow in summary.</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p><img src="../test/crypto/make.jpg" alt="See Makefile for text version" /></p>


<p></p>


<p>The bit at the bottom shows how the picture itself, <code>make.svg</code>,
was generated from the Makefile - via RDF of course. Some people have
actually started to use RDF just because of the diagram drawing facility, but
we hope by this stage that you will have a longer term and wider vision of
the value of Semantic Web!</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p></p>


<p>You will notice that in this example we didn't use a PKI certificates
looked up in a x.509 hierarchy. We could have. We would have used an RDF
interface to PKI.</p>


<p>There are two interesting reasons not to. One is that in designing the
system from scratch we defined exactly how it works. We defined what
information Alan signed about Kari, without involving any other information
actually identifying Kari as an individual person in the world. We don't need
to know Kari's social security number with the Finnish government. The key
represents Kari in the role he plays in this system. Because we are using
RDF, we can put whatever information into the certificate we like. We don't
have to worry about extending the certificate format. Because what we are
doing concerns the relationships between the social entities involved without
bringing in any superfluous external authority, it is more weblike in nature.
We are freer to model the actual social trust system we use.</p>


<p>The other interesting point is that the amount of software for working out
whether a request is valid is in fact quite small. The access rule is the
secure part which is specific to this system. Apart from that the trusted
code base is a general-purpose engine and a cryptographic library.</p>


<p>One can make the code base even smaller. Tiina can herself run the access
rule herself, and generate a proof - an output of the bits of data used and
rules used step by step. The web server then only has to check this proof.
Although it wasn't very difficult, it did involve running a simple inference
engine. Checking a proof is in fact simpler. (Cwm is being adapted to
generate proofs, but it can't do it yet for this case) . We assumed that
Tiina had a program to generate the request which know exactly how to do it.
You could imagine a more difficult situation in which her access agent had to
search for some connection between her and W3C, and find a way of justifying
the request. In this case, finding the credentials could have taken a long
time, or used special knowledge -- things which the web server itself
wouldn't want to worry about. The proof sent would then contain just the
essential information actually used to justify entry.  The web server's
trusted code base would be a proof checker and a digital signature validator.
 That's the sort of thing it every processor could have in ROM when it is
made.</p>


<p>The ability to write rules about what document actually says what allows
us to make systems which behave in predicatable and appropriate ways in the
real world. Cryptography gives use the ability to build secure systems, which
in a weblike way allow us to express what the real trust situation.</p>
