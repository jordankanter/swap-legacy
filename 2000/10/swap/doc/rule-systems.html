<h1>Comparing Rule-Based Systems</h1>

<p>Cwm acts as a rules processor, using information written in N3 rules to
guide it in manipulating the RDF/N3 information it has stored. While rules
processors are not exactly commonplace, and understanding them is not
manditory for the working programmer, they do have a long and solid history.
Where does cwm fit into that history?</p>

<p>The field has sometimes been called <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?knowledge-based+system">Knowledge-Based
Systems</a> or <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?expert+system">Expert
Systems</a>, but now people often just says something "uses rules." </p>


<h2>Four Kinds of Rules</h2>

<p>There seem to be four different ways people think about and want to
use rules:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Derivation or Deduction Rules.</strong>  These are cwm's
normal rules.   Each rule expresses the knowledge that if one set
of statements happens to be true, then some other set of
statements must also be true.  In most cases this is the same as what
is sometimes called a <em>logical implication</em>, a
<em>material conditional</em>, or a <em>Horn clause</em>.
</li>

<li><strong>Transformation Rules.</strong>  These are what cwm uses
with --filter.  Each rule relates truth in one knowledge base to truth
in another.  Transformation rules on n-tuples can be rewritten as
derivation rules on (n+1)-tuples, where the additional element
specifies the knowledge base.
</li>

<li><strong>Integrity Constraints.</strong>  These are rules of the
form "it must be true that ....".   Cwm does not have these rules, but
they can be emulated with derivation rules like "if it is not true
that .... then we-have-an-error" and a check for "we-have-and-error".
</li>

<li><strong>Reaction or Event-Condition-Action (ECA) Rules.</strong>
These involve a notion of action, not just inference, when a rule
applies.  Reaction rules may be emulated by wrapping a reaction rule
system in a procedure which queries for actions to perform.
</li>

</ol>


<h2>A Varierty of Engines</h2>

Along with the variety in types of rules, there is also a wide variety
in types of rules engines and general logic processors or "reasoners".

<h3>Automated Theorem Provers</h3>

<p>Automated reasoning using first-order became generally feasible in
1965 with Robinson's resolution and hyperresolution algorithms. Today
a raft of automated theorem provers continue this tradition, but they
see little use in general computing.  The strength here is general
expressive power: the machine does perform classical logic operations;
the weakness is that such systems generally become too practical,
real-world application problems.</p>

<p>A focal point for this research is <a href="http://www.tptp.org">Thousands
of Problems for Theorem-Provers (TPTP)</a>, which includes links to provers
and a conversion utility between logic languages. You can play a little with
its <a href="http://www.cs.jcu.edu.au/cgi-bin/tptp/tptp2X">web form</a> (try
problem ALG001-1).</p>

<p>In the RDF/Semantic Web community, people have used at least <a
href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/otter/">OTTER</a> and <a
href="http://belo.stanford.edu:8080/iwregistrar/Lookup?type=1&amp;value=SNARK&amp;mode=full">SNARK</a>.</p>

<h3>Logic Programming</h3>

<p>In 1970-1972, <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?Prolog">Prolog</a>
introduced <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?logic+programming">Logic
Programming</a>, which took a restricted form of first-order logic (Horn
clauses) and offered to prove things with them in a deterministic order, very
much like running a program. Prolog always chains backward from a query.</p>

<p>(1970-1975 also <a
href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/art19.htm">saw</a> the introduction
of C, Pascal, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Microsoft BASIC.)</p>

<p>Tabled Prolog (as in <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/">XSB</a>)
allows rules to be written without worrying about looping, much like
with cwm.</p>

<h3>Production Systems</h3>

<p>A different approach became popular with <a
href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?OPS5">OPS5</a>
(which is since continued into 
<a href="http://www.ghg.net/clips/CLIPS.html">CLIPS</a> and 
<a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/">JESS</a>), presenting
rules as being "triggered" and causing actions.</p>
 
<p>Unlike Prolog, these are usually (but not always) chaining forward
from the givens, like cwm.</p>

<h3>Modern Reasoners</h3>

<p>Modern reasoners and rule systems often use a complex hybrid of
strategies, or are simply developed for a focussed application
domain.</p>

<p>Some worth mentioning include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Euler handles N3 and many of cwm's operations, using a backward
chaining approach with loop-avoidance techniques.</li>

<li><a href="http://belo.stanford.edu:8080/iwregistrar/Lookup?type=1&amp;value=JTP&amp;mode=full
">JTP</a> is used for web-reasoning in the
<a href="http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/software/IW/">KSL InferenceWeb project</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.fh-wedel.de/~mo/racer/">RACER</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/FaCT/">FaCT</a> are leading description-logic
(ontology) reasoners</li>

<li><a href="http://www.opencyc.org/">OpenCyc</a> </li>
