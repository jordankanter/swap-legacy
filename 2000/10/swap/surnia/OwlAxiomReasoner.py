"""

   An OWL Reasoner which doesn't really do any work itself; it just
   mixes in axioms and hands the job off to some general purpose
   reasoner.

   The other reasoner should match the axioms, eg XSB can be used for
   Horn Axioms, while OTTER is more suitable for FOL axioms.

   This might be subclassed from AxiomReasoner and/or Reasoner some
   day, when there are more sorts of users.
