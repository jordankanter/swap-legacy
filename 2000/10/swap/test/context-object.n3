# Just a test of a problem in outputting a particular combination of nodes.


# Failure was in dpo tests:
#
#    :Ax033     =  (
#        :PropertyValue 
#        :subClassOf 
#        :ConstraintResource 
#        :Resource  );
#         a ko:Axiom;
#         <convert.n3#inN3>  [
#             a log:Truth .                 # woops! can't have . in [] except at end
#        :Ax033     <convert.n3#inN3> {:ConstraintResource     :subClassOf :Resource .
#            } ] .

# Here is a simple example of something which is context, subject, and object:
 
@prefix : <#> .
{ :sky :color :blue } is :inN3 of :Ax033; a :Truth .

# Incorrect answer:
#  :Ax033     :inN3  [
#           a :Truth .
#      :Ax033     :inN3 {:sky :color :blue
#          } ] .
#
#  Answer after a fix -- partially satisfactory as it has an extra =
#  which will fall out to the original after a coreference shakedown.
#   ("unification"?)
#
#    :Ax033     :inN3  [
#             a :Truth;
#             = {
#            :sky     :color :blue .
#            } ] .
