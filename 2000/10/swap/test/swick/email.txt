I believe that cwm's handling of relative URIs is not correctly
preserving base document URIs in its result.

Here is another case, of a slightly different nature:

Given a document named cwm_baseURI_test2.rdf with content

[[
<rdf:RDF 
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" >

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#obj1">
  <dc:creator>Ralph</dc:creator>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#obj2">
  <dc:creator>Also Ralph</dc:creator>
</rdf:Description>

</rdf:RDF>
]]

The command

% cwm --rdf cwm_baseURI_test2.rdf --n3

produces:

[[
#Processed by Id: cwm.py,v 1.129 2003/04/08 16:12:43 timbl Exp

     @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

    :obj1     dc:creator "Ralph" .

    :obj2     dc:creator "Also Ralph" .

#ENDS
]]

I get the same output if I use --n3=r for the output and also if
I give a full file: URI for the input (matching what cwm reported
as the base URI in the comment in its output), whereas I would like
to see full URIs for 
file:/tux/u2/swick/Projects/zakim/cwm_baseURI_test2.rdf#obj1
and
file:/tux/u2/swick/Projects/zakim/cwm_baseURI_test2.rdf#obj2

Furthermore, given the input

[[
<rdf:RDF 
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" >

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#obj1">
  <dc:creator>Ralph</dc:creator>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:about="cwm_baseURI_test2a#obj2">
  <dc:creator>Also Ralph</dc:creator>
</rdf:Description>

</rdf:RDF>
]]

the command

% cwm --rdf cwm_baseURI_test2a.rdf --n3

produces

[[

    :obj2     dc:creator "Also Ralph" .

    <#obj1>     dc:creator "Ralph" .

#ENDS
]]

Which does provide the (equivalent of) the full URI for obj2
but something that seems entirely wrong for the name of obj1.

I believe that these two inputs are equivalent (modulo the
filename modified for test purposes) and that the two statements
in test2a are describing objects whose names are identical but
for the final character.

Am I misunderstanding something, or is cwm?

My need is to preserve the full uri of things identified using
the RDF/XML 'about="#foo"' syntax in cwm's results.
