      When a request passes through a proxy that affects the content
      that may satisfy a request (such as a transcoding proxy), this
      property links from a new request profile resource to the
      outbound client or request profile.

      property links from a new request profile resource to the profile

      A proxy profile has a number of proxyBehavior properties,
      each of which describes some aspect of the proxy's
      capabilities.

      This is one of three properties to describe a proxy behavior.

      If this property is present, the behavior associated with the
      corresponding ccpp:Proxy-behavior resource is applied only if
      the outbound request profile indicates capabilities that match
      all those of the Component that is the object of this property.

      This is one of three properties to describe a proxy behavior.

      If this property is present, it indicates capabilities that
      are allowed in addition to those indicated by the outbound
      request profile.

      This is one of three properties to describe a proxy behavior.

      If this property is present, it indicates capabilities that
      are blocked,  even when they are indicated by the outbound
      request profile.
