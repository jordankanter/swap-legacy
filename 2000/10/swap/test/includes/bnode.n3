# Although this works, proof of this can't be checked:
# {{ []  a :foo } log:includes { [] a :foo }} => { :test1 a :SUCCESS }.

# because....the following sort of thiung doesn't work:

{  {{[] a :foo}=> {:a :b :c}} log:includes  {{[] a :foo}=> {:a :b :c}} }
=> {:test2 a :SUCCESS}.


# because log:includes doesn't unify down many levels, we rely on
# statement cannonicalization which is not extended to arbitrary
# identifiers of bnodes. (graph isomorphism problem). On the someday pile.
