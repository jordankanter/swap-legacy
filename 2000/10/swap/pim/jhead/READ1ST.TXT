THIS (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/jhead) is NOT
the home of this code.  It is part of the CVS tree of the
swap tree as a pragmatic measure as a JPEG>N3 conversion tool,
but anyone working with sources or looking for the 
latest version of this software should go to the source,
Matthias Wandel.

I found the originals at his web site
http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

He did the work of untangling the EXIF tags within 
JPEG JFIF files.

he says, """I got my information on the Exif format from:
http://www.ba.wakwak.com/~tsuruzoh/Computer/Digicams/exif-e.html

The official specs have since appeared on the web at:
http://www.pima.net/standards/it10/PIMA15740/exif.htm

"""
for the record.
