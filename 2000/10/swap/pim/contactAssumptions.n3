dc:description """
 Contact, FOAF, vCard and LDIF vocabularies all cover contact information 
 for people.  The mappings in contactStitch.n3 sometimes produce 
 ambiguities, which these asumptions will clear up.  If they are true for your data.
 They should not be taken as generally applicable facts and should be used with care.

# In  many countries, the opposite

con:givenName owl:equivalentProperty con:firstName. # Western only!
con:familyName owl:equivalentProperty con:lastName. # Assumpion made by much software.


#  The FOAF system requires that a foaf:mbox is owned by only one person.
# The same with con:mailbox.
# This is not necessarily true of vcard and ldif mailboxes, but is often
# a useful asumption with a controlled dataset.
